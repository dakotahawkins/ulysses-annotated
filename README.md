This is a git repository of the source files for the annotated epub version of Ulysses by Joyce, James.

It was forked from https://github.com/GITenberg/Ulysses_4300 and updated with scripts for generating an annotated version of the book,  with annotations taken from http://joyceproject.com/.

The annotated epub is regenerated once a week using github actions, to updated it with the latest notes from the website.

To read more about the epub file and to download the latest version,  visit [joyceproject.com](http://www.joyceproject.com/pages/ebook.htm).  Older versions can be found in the [releases page](https://github.com/shsms/ulysses-annotated/releases).

Instructions for manually generating the epub can be found [here](annotations.md).
