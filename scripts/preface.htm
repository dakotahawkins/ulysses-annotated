<h2>Preface</h2>
<a name="link2H_4_preface" id="link2H_4_preface"> <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>

<p class="preface">
  For many of us, James Joyce’s <i>Ulysses</i> is the most richly
  satisfying novel ever written. Like Shakespeare’s plays or Homer’s
  epic poems it can be read again and again, each time with increased
  understanding and pleasure. It is one of those literary texts whose
  possibilities never come close to being exhausted.
</p>

<p class="preface">
  But anyone hoping to tackle this monster for the first time is in
  for a struggle. Dozens of unfamiliar allusions teem on every page,
  commenting on the action in precise, subtle, and multifarious
  ways. Hundreds of musical references beg not only to be understood,
  but heard. Puzzles and enigmas lurk everywhere, asking readers to
  weigh evidence and track down leads like detectives. Past events
  seep into the present through characters’ individual memories and
  through collectively remembered history. Places remember past events
  and become attached to mental states in the present, making even the
  city a text to read.  Distinctive details and phrases recur
  repeatedly, establishing connections across dozens or even hundreds
  of pages and requiring readers to step outside the temporal
  sequence, viewing events from an Olympian perspective. Characters’
  voices compete with third-person narration for control of the story,
  and new kinds of narration emerge from chapter to chapter, changing
  the rules of the game whenever one begins to feel too comfortable.
</p>

<p class="preface">
  Challenges like these impel readers to look for help outside the
  text, and over the course of nearly a century commentators have
  labored to supply it, in the process becoming better readers
  themselves. But even with help from people who know the book well
  and can communicate its mysteries effectively, there is only so much
  that anyone can take in on a first reading. Until the shape of the
  entire book is imprinted in one’s memory, like the map of an
  often-walked city, too much information can only be an annoyance
  hindering one’s passage from sentence to sentence. After that
  threshold is crossed, more begins to be better.
</p>

<p class="preface">
  The online notes that I have been publishing for about ten years
  address such challenges, not least the gulf separating new and
  experienced readers. First-time readers of the novel want just
  enough commentary to make some minimal sense of a baffling sentence,
  freeing them to move on to the next one. Veterans want anything but
  that. The solution I have devised is to begin each note with an
  introductory paragraph that conveys the most essential contextual
  information and some succinct suggestion of how to use it, and then
  to build “in the broadest way immarginable,” as Joyce said
  in <i>Finnegans Wake</i>.  Readers who click on a “Read more” button
  after the first paragraph can explore an allusion in more detail,
  think about how knowing it may shape the reading process, entertain
  alternative interpretations, attend to what various scholars have
  written, make connections to other passages in the novel, and so
  on. These later paragraphs speak primarily to more experienced
  readers. The opening paragraphs, and this Preface, are addressed
  primarily to newcomers.

  Sahas Subramanian created the ebook that you are viewing in order to
  provide a downloadable copy of my annotated <i>Ulysses</i> that
  users can store on their devices and consult even when not connected
  to the internet.  As I keep adding notes to the website, and
  sometimes revising, his software will make weekly updates. Before
  you begin reading, it may be helpful to learn a few things about the
  ebook, the website, and annotation generally.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p class="preface-li">
      Annotators of <i>Ulysses</i> must strike a balance between
      informing and interpreting. Neither exists in a pure state:
      simply noting an allusion to something outside the text
      constitutes an act of interpretation, and interpretations
      uninformed by such contexts will gain little traction. Still,
      commentators tend to emphasize one or the other. Some try to be
      as objective as possible, briefly detailing things like literary
      references, historical events, song lyrics, and Dublin
      locations, while not telling readers how to use the
      information. Others act as tour guides, isolating interesting
      and important features of each chapter and suggesting paths for
      a reader to take through it. My notes begin with information,
      identifying problematic issues and offering contexts for
      understanding them, but they also explore the consequences that
      follow from accepting a context as relevant. The goal is not to
      perform readings of the entire novel, but to better appreciate
      significant threads running through Joyce’s incredibly elaborate
      tapestry.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="preface-li">
      On the principle that conceptual learning is facilitated by
      visual and auditory learning, all the commentary on the website
      is accompanied by still images and/or sound recordings and
      videos. Some of these multimedia frames in the note sidebars use
      photographs, artworks, and graphics simply to illustrate things
      discussed in the note.  Others purvey more directly useful
      resources like annotated Dublin maps, photographs and recordings
      from Joyce’s era, old advertisements, physical objects,
      newspaper columns, musical performances, streets, buildings, and
      landforms. The site also has a comprehensive alphabetical list
      of “People in the Novel” (there are hundreds) and a not yet
      comprehensive chronological list of “Times in the Novel,”
      beginning long before June 16, 1904. Ebook readers will miss
      these resources unless they make a practice of checking the
      website from time to time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="preface-li">
      The website uses hyperlinks within the text rather than note
      numbers, in six colors that signal different kinds of content
      addressed within the notes. This allows readers to concentrate
      on topics that interest them as they travel through the
      novel. Rather than hyperlinks the ebook employs traditional note
      numbers, but Subramanian has replicated the colors of my links
      in his note numbers for anyone who wishes to read notes on the
      land, culture, and history of Ireland (green), various kinds of
      Literature (orange), the cityscape of Dublin (brown), musical
      and dramatic Performances (purple), issues pertaining to the
      human Body (red), or the artistic choices of the Writer
      (blue). Sometimes a colored symbol within a note will signal a
      transition to a new kind of content. A more detailed listing of
      the topics addressed in my six categories can be found on the
      website under “Color Coding.” An ebook without the colors is
      also available.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="preface-li">
      Many notes on the website, probably a majority of them, are
      linked to more than one passage in the novel. This practice
      allows me to join closely related passages, both within chapters
      and in different chapters, and to write essay-like notes that do
      not simply explicate local cruxes but address larger issues
      within the novel. Different note numbers within the ebook may
      sometimes take you to the same note, and in notes glossing
      multiple passages you may find that your question about a
      passage is not well answered in the opening paragraph. These
      would be times to “Read more,” moving on to the paragraph that
      addresses your question. To help readers find what they are
      looking for in longer notes, and to save them from having to
      toggle back and forth between novel and commentary, I quote
      generously from the passages being glossed and emphasize the
      most relevant parts with boldfaced type. Looking for a boldfaced
      quotation of your passage can help you quickly narrow your
      search.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="preface-li">
      For anyone who wishes to consult these notes in conjunction with
      a traditional book, the website offers a way to divide its
      continuous electronic text to match the pagination of five
      commonly sold print editions.  Lineation is not reproduced, only
      page numbers, but this feature of the site can be very useful
      for locating passages within a printed text. There are several
      reasons why you might want to do this, including a wish to
      record your own notes within the margins of a printed text while
      using the ebook or the website.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="preface-li">
      I am the sole author of more than 98% of the notes on the
      website. Other people have written the remaining ones, or
      co-written them with me. Authors and years of electronic
      publication are recorded at the bottom of notes, but this
      information is not reproduced in the ebook. Many notes cite the
      findings of other scholars, whether from print sources,
      websites, or personal communications, with fuller information
      supplied on “Sources” and “Contributors” pages on the
      website. These pages too are absent from the ebook.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="preface-li">
      In keeping with the cross-referential, recursive, and cumulative
      nature of the novel, most of the website’s notes contain links
      to other notes.  As with the infinitely extendable notes, the
      idea is to make more information available at every step. One
      result may be that, rather than simply taking up topics as they
      arise sequentially in the course of reading, a user will follow
      other paths through Joyce’s maze, much as looking up one word in
      a dictionary may lead to others, or (a more exact analogy)
      investigating one topic on Wikipedia may lead to other topics
      through the hyperlinks in the article. The ebook does not
      reproduce these links—which may not be a bad thing for people
      trying to get through the book for the first time!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="preface-li">
      The ebook text, which is being automatically updated to mirror
      the text on the website, is not precisely identical to the
      Gutenberg version of the novel or to that of any print
      edition. It represents my own ongoing effort to approximate an
      ideal text, choosing among literally thousands of textual
      variations from edition to edition of <i>Ulysses</i>—most of
      them small, but some quite consequential.  Some notes discuss
      the editorial issues involved in these choices, usually long
      after the “Read more” division.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="preface-li">
      Stopping at “Read more” will spare you the curse of being
      overwhelmed by too much secondary material, but it may also
      leave you unsatisfied. You will need to work out a balance
      between reading too little and too much—a quandary that is not
      unique to this collection of annotations, but bedevils all
      first-time readers of <i>Ulysses</i>.  Avoid published
      commentary altogether and most of the book flies right over your
      head. Dig into it too deeply and you lose the absorbing,
      enjoyable flow of reading a novel. Many coping strategies have
      been suggested, such as reading a paragraph or page without
      notes, then reading the relevant notes, and then reading the
      text a second time. You will need to find your own best practice
      by trial and error.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="preface-li">
      Since my guiding principle is to give users as much as they can
      handle, the notes may contain “spoilers.”  Some annotators
      believe that buried surprises should be left for neophytes to
      discover on their own, much later. I resist this view, for
      several reasons: <i>Ulysses</i> is not the kind of book that can
      be ruined by knowing what happens; first-timers need all the
      help they can get; and withholding assistance perpetuates the
      privilege of those in the know, essentially taunting others to
      prove their worth. In my opinion life is too short, and the book
      too difficult, for such an exclusionary attitude. Nevertheless,
      when some disclosure could spoil the pleasurable challenge of
      individual discovery I try to keep it out of the opening
      paragraph. People intrepid enough to read more will be admitted
      to the insiders’ club free of charge, except perhaps for loss of
      innocence.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="preface">
  Finally, a few words about my own involvement. <i>The Joyce
  Project</i> started as an idea for helping my students. I envisioned
  a site where all their questions could be addressed by clicking on
  links rather than having to flip through multiple reference
  works. But as I started writing notes I saw that I would not be
  content with simply reproducing other people’s observations, or with
  presenting issues in a cursory way.  Tracking down information on my
  own meant weighing evidence more actively than when I was merely
  trying to summarize others’ findings. Addressing multiple passages
  within notes meant asking questions that had not always been asked
  before. Scrutinizing possible sources and contexts led me to
  discoveries not recorded in other commentaries. And, most crucially,
  trying to explain <i>exactly</i> how some background information
  might shape a reading of a passage meant that I was forever seeing
  new things in Joyce’s text. Instead of mere crutches for a beginner
  limping through the book, my notes were becoming platforms on which
  textual problems could be laid out in detail and examined from many
  angles. I had to write notes in my own way, at greater length, and
  devise a new form for doing it. The project became much bigger than
  I had imagined.
</p>

<p class="preface">
  One published commentator has remarked that the joys
  of <i>Ulysses</i> belong to the reader and not to the annotator. Not
  so for me! Each new note now feels to me like a portal of discovery,
  to borrow a phrase from the novel’s ninth chapter. When I first read
  this book as an ignorant but eager college student, I knew that it
  was extraordinary and would draw me back. More than four decades
  later it draws me back still, with no less freshness than the first
  time, and with no less sense that I have much to learn. Looking
  carefully at some long-familiar passage I find, again and again,
  that I have not remembered something quite exactly enough, or looked
  quite hard enough for analogues and implications. Some little detail
  of Joyce’s choosing makes the book even more astonishingly
  hyper-significant than I thought. This sense of unextinguished
  discovery drives me to keep writing notes as I begin my second year
  of retirement, and I hope it will do so for years to come. For
  anyone trying to read the daunting masterpiece for the first time, I
  hope my notes will give you the threads you need to find your own
  way through the labyrinth, and I hope that you too will find a
  life’s companion in this remarkable work.
